Ruby Port for Python's Codenamize
==================================================

This folder contains the original python version of [codenamize][1], which
was used as the basis for this ruby port.

It is kept here for reference and for historic preservation, as this is 
considered **Version 0**.

The code is zipped to prevent GitHub from identifying this repository as 
a python one, and to avoid code coverage drops.
